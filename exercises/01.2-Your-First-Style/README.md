# `01.2` Your First Style

When doing CSS, the idea is to apply `css rules` to your `html elements`, you always have to select the element first, and then specify what rules you want to apply to it:

For example, this is the code if I want to make all my website anchors (`<a> tag's`) blue:

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Right now there is a style being applied that is responsable of making the anchor red.
2. Change the style to make your anchor look yellow.
