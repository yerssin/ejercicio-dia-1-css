# `02.1` Background

The `background` CSS rule allows us to assign and work with the background of any container. The background values can be a `color` or an `image`.

If it is an image you can specify if you want the image to repeat horizontally, vertically, both, or not at all, and you can also specify if you want it to resize and fit the whole container where its being applied, among other properties that can be modified.

## üìù Instructions:


1.  Build the exercise.
2.  Check the Preview.
3.  On the styles.css file the background-size to 'contain' (check the styles.css tab).
4.  Build and Preview the exercise again.
5.  Change the background-repeat to 'inherit' to make it repeat over the x axis and y axis.
6.  Build and Preview the exercise again.
