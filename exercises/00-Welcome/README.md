# Welcome to CSS Exercises!!

My name is Alejandro Sanchez [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr). I'm really excited to have you here !! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜‚
Learning to code is hard, you need coaching! DM me on twitter if you have any question.

During this course you will be learning the following concepts:

1. How to apply CSS to your website in 3 different ways: Inline, by grouping them together inside a `<style>` tag or using an exeternal stylesheet `<link>`,
2. Selecting HTML Elements from your website to apply the styles to.
3. Apply CSS Rules (styles) to those elements.
4. Use the most popular CSS Rules.
5. Learn the most popular CSS Tricks.

As you may have noticed, HTML allows you to create only basic websites. Nobody wants to see a white website with some horrible text on it. So it's time to learn what is CSS all about! Learn CSS to make your website beautiful. Let's make it shine!
