# `12` Relative Length EM, REM

By now, we are used to working with pixels as measurement unit, for example, saying that a box has 100px of width.

There are other types of units that are not fixed, but relative. We use them when we want the element size to be related to another element or measurement unit.

### Example using em:
In this exercise we have two `<h2>` headings. They are both `<h2>`, but one is bigger than the other because headings have relative font-sizes by default. Since the first div has a bigger based font-size, then the heading resizes accordingly.

```Plain/Text
em: Relative to the current font-size of the parent.
rem: Relative to the original font-size of the page.
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Give a font-size of 0.8em to both h2's
2. Now give a font-size of 0.8rem to both h3's


The result should look like this:
